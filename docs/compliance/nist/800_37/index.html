<p>One of the key guiding documents that Federal agencies use to adhere to FISMA
requirements is that of <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-37/rev-1/final">NIST Special Publication (SP)
800-37</a>, <em>Guide
for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal Information Systems: a
security Life Cycle Approach</em>. This document provides a detailed, six-step
approach to risk management, known as the Risk Management Framework (RMF):
categorize, select, implement, assess, authorize, and monitor. Agencies across
the Federal government, including the Federal Civilian sector, Department of
Defense, and the Intelligence Community, all incorporate and mandate this
process in some form or fashion.</p>

<p><img src="/compliance/images/nistrmf.png" alt="NIST RMF" />
<sub>Source - NIST SP 800-37 Rev. 1</sub></p>

<p>The primary goal for any Federal information system is to attain an authority to
operate (ATO), which validates a system for use and is one of the final phases
of the risk management framework. To help agencies attain ATOs for Docker
Enterprise Edition (EE) and containerized systems built on top of Docker EE,
we’ve highlighted some considerations and corresponding components of the Docker
stack as they map to applicable requirements of the Risk Management Framework
(RMF), per NIST 800-37 Rev. 1, and other supporting publications. The guidance
below has been generalized and can also be tailored to fit the requirements of
CNSSI 1253, DoD RMF per DoDI 8510.01, and/or other applicable Federal government
assessment and authorization processes.</p>

<p>It is important to note that the information below merely serves as guidance and
cannot nor should not be used as the sole source of information in your agency’s
Docker-related ATO efforts. Furthermore, only the Docker Enterprise Edition (EE)
product is the most suitable for use per the various FISMA requirements. Docker
Community Edition (CE) lacks many critical security and support capabilities
that which are required by NIST SP 800-53 controls and mandatory FIPS standards
and therefore cannot be used to process Federal information without the
assumption of a significantly greater level of risk to your organization.</p>

<h2 id="docker-platform-information-system-boundaries-and-categorizations">Docker Platform Information System Boundaries and Categorizations</h2>

<p>Because Docker introduces a relatively new containerization computing paradigm
into Federal information systems, it can be challenging for system owners to
identify appropriate system boundaries. Per NIST 800-37 Rev. 1, Docker EE and
its containerized workloads can be best classified as a net-centric architecture
made up of a complex system of systems that also encompasses dynamic subsystems.</p>

<p>To guide information system owners in this process, we’ve laid out a couple of
high-level technical recommendations as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Classify the Docker Enterprise Edition stack itself and all of its components
as a <strong>general support system</strong>, as defined by OMB Circular A-130. This
includes the Docker EE Engine, Docker Trusted Registry (DTR), and Universal
Control Plane (UCP). The Docker EE stack will typically reside on another
existing general support system with an existing ATO (e.g. Federal datacenter
facility, FedRAMP-certified cloud service provider, etc).</li>
  <li>Classify each containerized workload as a <strong>major application</strong>, as defined by
OMB Circular A-130. For the purposes of this particular recommendation, a
<em>containerized workload</em> is the equivalent of a Docker Swarm Mode stack (one
or more Swarm Mode services) or a Kubernetes deployment (one or more
deployments). Supporting artifacts for Swarm Mode stacks and Kubernetes
deployments should also be included as part of the application system boundary
as appropriate (e.g. overlay networks, Docker secrets, Kubernetes services,
volumes, etc). Each containerized workload should be considered a dynamic
subsystem of the Docker EE stack.</li>
</ul>

<p>Individual Docker EE engines that are serving containerized workloads but that
are not part of a UCP cluster should be considered wholly separate systems (or
subsystems) as part of the ATO process.</p>

<p>In addition to using the guidance above to identify your Docker system
boundaries, you should also continue to categorize your Docker deployment and
its containerized workloads per the guidelines set forth in FIPS 199 and NIST SP
800-60. Furthermore, it is likely that you will have non-technical,
organizational system requirements that will have an impact on the
determination of the Docker system boundary.</p>

<p>NIST 800-37 Rev. 2, which is set to be released later in 2018, aims to modify
some of these system-related definitions and introduces the constructs of system
elements, systems-of-interest, and enabling systems. This guidance will be
updated to reflect these changes accordingly.</p>

<h2 id="security-control-selection">Security Control Selection</h2>

<p>NIST SP 800-53, <em>Security and Privacy Controls for Federal Information Systems
and Organizations</em> is the primary directory of security controls used to secure
information systems per FISMA requirements. There are 900+ controls in this
publication, many of which are applicable to both the Docker EE stack itself and
any containers that are deployed on top. All of the 800-53 controls that we have
deemed applicable to and/or configurable within Docker Enterprise Edition are
documented in our <a href="/compliance/reference/800-53/">NIST 800-53 Reference</a> and on
<a href="https://www.github.com/docker/compliance">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have categorized your Docker deployment and/or your containerized
application workloads per FIPS 199 and SP 800-60, you should proceed with the
requirements set forth in FIPS 200 and guidance in SP 800-53 to develop your
system’s minimum security baseline (MSB). The controls we’ve documented for
Docker are irrespective of the LOW, MODERATE, and HIGH NIST baselines, and as
such, can be selected per your system’s MSB.</p>

<p>If you are pursuing an application ATO for your containerized workload(s), you
should take into account common controls provided by both the Docker EE stack
itself and any supporting infrastructure underneath (e.g. cloud service provider
IaaS, Federal datacenter etc). Typically, inheriting a greater number of common
controls as part of your Docker EE deployment and/or containerized workload
ATO(s) results in more consistent, cost-effective, and time-effective ATO
processes.</p>

<p><img src="/compliance/images/atocontrolresponsibilities.svg" alt="" /></p>

<h2 id="implementing-security-controls">Implementing Security Controls</h2>

<p>Many of the controls that we’ve documented can be classified as types of hybrid
controls. More specifically, some of our narratives are simply statements
highlighting container capabilities or the Docker EE stack that can be used to
assist in your implementation of a control, but do not necessarily provide a
complete control implementation in and of themselves. Examples of these include
a number of the management-focused control families (e.g. CA, PL, PM, RA, and
SA). Other control narratives that we’ve provided require you to configure a
capability in Docker <em>in addition to</em> relying on external system components to
fully satisfy a control. This is true for many of the controls in the Access
Control (AC) family whereby Docker includes the option to configure integration
with Active Directory or similar LDAP technology, but doesn’t itself provide
that directory service capability.</p>

<p>Each control narrative in our NIST 800-53 reference includes instructions (or a
link to instructions) for configuring Docker EE appropriately.</p>

<h2 id="assessing-docker-security-controls">Assessing Docker Security Controls</h2>

<p>When assessing the controls that you’ve implemented for a Docker EE deployment
and its containerized workloads, you should continue to follow the guidance and
procedures outlined in NIST SP 800-53A and NIST SP 800-115. In the event that
your security control assessor (SCA) is unfamiliar with high-level container
constructs, it may help to incorporate some of these concepts into your Rules of
Engagement (ROE) document.</p>

<p>Many of the commonly used test and audit tools used in traditional security
control assessments can also be used to validate control implementations
specific to Docker EE. Results from Docker Trusted Registry vulnerability scans,
Docker EE Engine, UCP and DTR logs, overlay network configurations, and exposed
container ports are a few of the multitude of different Docker system and
containerized application components that can be included as part of an
assessment.</p>

<h2 id="authorizing-a-docker-ee-based-system">Authorizing a Docker EE-based system</h2>

<p>As with any system authorization, only the authorizing official (AO) can make
the appropriate authority to operate (or denial of authority to operate)
decision. Educating your organization’s AO, Authorizing Official Designated
Representative (AODR), and/or Risk Executive on container technologies and some
of their high-level security capabilities can aid these individuals in
evaluating any residual risks associated with the use of Docker EE and support
their decision-making processes.</p>

<p>Certainly don’t hesitate to contact your Docker representative or reach out to
compliance@docker.com if you’ve identified any Docker EE-specific product gaps
or security weaknesses as part of your compilation of the Plan of Action and
Milestones (POA&amp;M) artifacts associated with this step of RMF.</p>

<h2 id="continuous-monitoring">Continuous Monitoring</h2>

<p>One of the key considerations to take into account when expanding your
organization’s continuous monitoring program to cover your Docker Enterprise
deployment is that of automation. <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/sp/800-137/final">NIST SP
800-137</a>,
<em>Information Security Continuous Monitoring (ISCM) for Federal Information
Systems and Organizations</em>, emphasizes the use of automation to support
continuous monitoring and highlights 11 automation domains that are all
applicable to Docker Enterprise. The table below maps each automation domain to
that of a capability provided by Docker EE and containers and steps for
incorporating that functionality into your ISCM program. These mappings do not
provide for completeness in satisfying a particular automation domain, but
rather a starting point from which to integrate Docker EE with other ISCM tools
in your environment.</p>
