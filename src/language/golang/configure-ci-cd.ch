This page guides you through the process of setting up a GitHub Action CI/CD pipeline with Docker containers. Before setting up a new pipeline, we recommend that you take a look at [Ben's blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/best-practices-for-using-docker-hub-for-ci-cd/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} on CI/CD best practices.
@y
本ページでは Docker コンテナーを利用した GitHub アクションの CI/CD パイプライン（pipeline）の設定について説明します。
新たなパイプラインを設定する前に、CI/CD のベストプラクティスとして [Ben のブログ](https://www.docker.com/blog/best-practices-for-using-docker-hub-for-ci-cd/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} を読んでおくことをお勧めします。

This guide contains instructions on how to:
@y
本ガイドでは以下の手順を説明します。
@z

@x
1. Set up continuous integration (CI) pipeline using GitHub Actions;
2. Enable Docker Hub access for continuous deployment (CD) tools;
3. Optimize your GitHub Actions-based CI/CD pipeline to reduce the number of pull requests and the total build time; and
4. Release only specific versions of your application to Docker Hub.
@y
1. GitHub アクションを使って継続的インテグレーション (CI) のパイプラインを設定します。
2. 継続的デプロイメント (CD) ツールに対して Docker Hub からのアクセスを有効にします。
3. GitHub アクションベースの CI/CD パイプラインを最適化して、プルリクエスト数と総ビルド時間を減らします。
4. 指定したアプリケーションバージョンのみを Docker Hub にリリースします。
@z

@x
> **Note**
>
> Before we begin, it must be said that Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) each is a _huge_ subject, with many different approaches and opinions. The approach chosen in this guide is optimised for pedagogical clarity and simplicity and is not meant to be the One True Way to test and release software.
@y
> **メモ**
>
> 話を進めるにあたり、継続的インテグレーション (CI) や継続的デプロイメント (CD) には、さまざまなアプローチや考え方がある、非常に「大きな」テーマであることをここで述べておきます。
> 本ガイドで進めるアプローチは、説明をわかりやすく単純にするために最適化したものであって、ソフトウェアのテストやリリースを行う際に、これが唯一の方法であると主張するものではありません。

Let’s get started. This guide uses a simple Go project as an example. In fact, it is the same project we got acquainted with in [Build Images](build-images.md) part of this guide. The [olliefr/docker-gs-ping](https://github.com/olliefr/docker-gs-ping){:target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="_"} repository contains the full source code and the `Dockerfile`. You can either fork it or to follow along and set up one of your own Go projects in a fashion described in this section.

This should be enough to test our approach to CI. Change the workflow file name from `main.yml` to `ci.yml` and press **Start commit** button. Fill out the commit details in your preferred style and press **Commit new file**. GitHub Actions are saved as YAML files in `.github/workflows` directory and GitHub web interface would do that for us.

* This workflow is only triggered when a git tag of the format `*.*.*` is pushed to the repo. The tag meant to be a semantic version, such as `3.5.0` or `0.0.1`.
* The very first step is to login into Docker Hub using the two secrets that we had saved in the repository settings previously.
* The _build and push_ step now has `push: true` and since we had logged into Docker Hub this will result in the latest image being published.
* The image digest step prints out the image metadata to the log.

We've just build a simple (maybe even naive) CI/CD workflow. There are many ways in which it can be improved. We'll look at some of these ways in the next section.

1. Build cache reduces the build time as it will not have to re-download all of the images, and
2. It also reduces the number of pulls we complete against Docker Hub. We need to make use of GitHub cache to make use of this.

Let us set up a Builder with a build cache. First, we need to set up the builder, and then to configure the cache. In this example, let us add the path and keys to store this under using GitHub cache for this.

GitHub Actions are an immensely powerful way to automate your CI and CD pipelines, and [there is a lot of documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) to aid you in that mission. It is not, however, the _only_ way to integrate containers into your workflow. The aim of this section was to show you some of the basic things that are possible. There is a multitude of CI and CD tools on the market and you are very welcome to investigate what integration with the container ecosystem they provide. Well defined, automated CI pipelines can save you and your team a lot of effort.

In this module, you have learnt how to set up GitHub Actions workflow to an existing dockerized Go project, optimize your workflow to improve build times and reduce the number of pull requests, and finally, we learnt how to push only specific versions to Docker Hub.

本節では、既存の Docker 化された Go 言語プロジェクトに対しての GitHub アクションワークフローの設定方法を学びました。
次にワークフローを最適化して、ビルド時間の改善とプルリクエスト数の削減を行いました。
そして特定のバージョンのみを Docker Hub にプッシュするようにしました。
