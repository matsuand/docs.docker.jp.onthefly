In this module, we'll take a look at running a database engine in a container and connecting it to the extended version of the example application. We are going to see some options for keeping persistent data and for wiring up the containers to talk to one another. Finally, we'll learn how to use Docker Compose to manage such multi-container local development environments effectively.

The database engine we are going to use is called [CockroachDB](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/product/). It is a modern, Cloud-native, distributed SQL database.

Instead of compiling CockroachDB from the source code or using the operating system's native package manager to install CockroachDB, we are going to use the [Docker image for CockroachDB](https://hub.docker.com/r/cockroachdb/cockroach) and run it in a container.

CockroachDB is compatible with PostgreSQL to a significant extent, and shares many conventions with the latter, particularly the default names for the environment variables. So, if you are familiar with Postgres, don't be surprised that we are going to use some familiar environment variables names. The Go modules that work with Postgres, such as [pgx](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx), [pq](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/lib/pq), [GORM](https://gorm.io/index.html), and [upper/db](https://upper.io/v4/) also work with CockroachDB.

The point of a database is to have a persistent store of data. [Volumes](../../storage/volumes.md) are the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. Thus, before we start CockroachDB, let's create the volume for it.

The example application and the database engine are going to talk to one another over the network. There are different kinds of network configuration possible, and we are going to use what is called a user-defined _bridge network_. It is going to provide us with a DNS lookup service so that we can refer to our database engine container by its hostname.

Our bridge network `mynet` has been created successfully. The other three networks, named `bridge`, `host`, and `none` are the _default_ networks and they had been created by the Docker itself. While it is not relevant to our current discussion, you can learn more about Docker networking in the [networking overview](../../network/index.md) section.

When choosing a name for a network or a managed volume, it's best to choose a name that is indicative of the intended purpose. In this module, though, we aimed for brevity, so we settled for short, generic names.

Notice a clever use of the tag `latest-v20.1` to make sure that we are pulling the latest patch version of 20.1.  The diversity of available tags depend on the image maintainer. Here, our intent was to have the latest patched version of CockroachDB while not straying too far away from the known working version as the time goes by. To see the tags available for CockroachDB image, we went to [CockroachDB page on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/cockroachdb/cockroach/tags).

Great! The count of records from the database is correct although we had not only _stopped_ the containers, but also removed them before starting new instances. The difference is in the managed volume for CockroachDB, which we had reused. The new CockroachDB container has read the database files from the disk, just as it normally would if it were running outside the container.

At this point, you might be wondering if there is a way to avoid having to deal with long lists of arguments to the `docker` command. The toy example we used in this series requires five environment variables to define the connection to the database. A real application might need many, _many_ more. Then there is also a question of dependencies &ndash; ideally, we would like to make sure that the database is started _before_ our application is run. And spinning up the database instance may require another Docker command with many options. But there is a better way to orchestrate these deployments for local development purposes.

* `PGUSER=${PGUSER:-totoro}` means that inside the container, the environment variable `PGUSER` shall be set to the same value as it has on the host machine where Docker Compose is run. If there is no environment variable with this name on the host machine, the variable inside the container gets the default value of `totoro`.
* `PGPASSWORD=${PGPASSWORD:?database password not set}` means that if the environment variable `PGPASSWORD` is not set on the host, Docker Compose will display an error. This is OK, because we don't want to hard-code default values for the password. We set the password value in the `.env` file, which is local to our machine. It is always a good idea to add `.env` to `.gitignore` to prevent the secrets being checked into the version control.

This is not a big deal. All we have to do is to connect to CockroachDB instance and run the three SQL commands to create the database and the user, as described above in the _Configure the database engine_ section above.

And execute the same commands as before to create the database `mydb`, the user `totoro`, and to grant that user necessary permissions. Once we do that (and the example application container is automatically restarted), the `rest-service` stops failing and restarting and the console goes quiet.

It would have been possible to connect the volume that we had previously used, but for the purposes of our example it's more trouble than it's worth and it also provided an opportunity to show how to introduce resilience into our deployment via the `restart_policy` Compose file feature.

A _managed volume_ isn't the only way to provide your container with persistent storage. It is highly recommended to get acquainted with available storage options and their use cases, covered in the following part of Docker documentation: [Manage data in Docker](../../storage/index.md).

We run a single instance of CockroachDB, which was enough for our demonstration. But it is possible to run a CockroachDB _cluster_, which is made of multiple instances of CockroachDB, each instance running in its own container. Since CockroachDB engine is distributed by design, it would have taken us surprisingly little change to our procedure to run a cluster with multiple nodes.

Such distributed set-up offers interesting possibilities, such as applying _Chaos Engineering_ techniques to simulate parts of the cluster failing and evaluating our application's ability to cope with such failures.

Since we did not run a cluster of CockroachDB instances, you might be wondering whether we could have used a non-distributed database engine. The answer is 'yes', and if we were to pick a more traditional SQL database, such as [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), the process described in this chapter would have been very similar.

In this module, we set up a containerised development environment with our application and the database engine running in different containers. We also wrote a Docker Compose file which links the two containers together and provides for easy starting up and tearing down of the development environment.
