As of v2.4.0 a garbage collector command is included within the registry binary.
This document describes what this command does and how and why it should be used.

@x
In the context of the Docker registry, garbage collection is the process of
removing blobs from the filesystem when they are no longer referenced by a
manifest. Blobs can include both layers and manifests.

@x
Registry data can occupy considerable amounts of disk space. In addition,
garbage collection can be a security consideration, when it is desirable to ensure
that certain layers no longer exist on the filesystem.

Filesystem layers are stored by their content address in the Registry. This
has many advantages, one of which is that data is stored once and referred to by manifests.
See [here](compatibility.md#content-addressable-storage-cas) for more details.

Layers are therefore shared amongst manifests; each manifest maintains a reference
to the layer. As long as a layer is referenced by one manifest, it cannot be garbage
collected.

@x
Manifests and layers can be `deleted` with the registry API (refer to the API
documentation [here](spec/api.md#deleting-a-layer) and
[here](spec/api.md#deleting-an-image) for details). This API removes references
to the target and makes them eligible for garbage collection. It also makes them
unable to be read via the API.

If a layer is deleted, it is removed from the filesystem when garbage collection
is run. If a manifest is deleted the layers to which it refers are removed from
the filesystem if no other manifests refers to them.

collected as it is still referenced by manifest `A`. The blob representing
manifest `B` is eligible for garbage collection.

### More details about garbage collection

### More details about garbage collection
@z

@x
Garbage collection runs in two phases. First, in the 'mark' phase, the process
scans all the manifests in the registry. From these manifests, it constructs a
set of content address digests. This set is the 'mark set' and denotes the set
of blobs to *not* delete. Secondly, in the 'sweep' phase, the process scans all
the blobs and if a blob's content address digest is not in the mark set, the
process deletes it.

@x
The garbage-collect command accepts a `--dry-run` parameter, which prints the progress
of the mark and sweep phases without removing any data. If you need to clean up untagged manifests as well, you can run the command with `--delete-untagged` parameter. Running with a log level of `info`
gives a clear indication of items eligible for deletion.
