If you have multiple instances of Docker running in your environment, such as
multiple physical or virtual machines all running Docker, each daemon goes out
to the internet and fetches an image it doesn't have locally, from the Docker
repository. You can run a local registry mirror and point all your daemons
there, to avoid this extra internet traffic.

Alternatively, if the set of images you are using is well delimited, you can
simply pull them manually and push them to a simple, local, private registry.

Furthermore, if your images are all built in-house, not using the Hub at all and
relying entirely on your local registry is the simplest scenario.

It's currently not possible to mirror another private registry. Only the central

The Registry can be configured as a pull through cache. In this mode a Registry
responds to all normal docker pull requests but stores all content locally.

@x
The first time you request an image from your local registry mirror, it pulls
the image from the public Docker registry and stores it locally before handing
it back to you. On subsequent requests, the local registry mirror is able to
serve the image from its own storage.

When a pull is attempted with a tag, the Registry checks the remote to
ensure if it has the latest version of the requested content. Otherwise, it
fetches and caches the latest content.

In environments with high churn rates, stale data can build up in the cache.
When running as a pull through cache the Registry periodically removes old
content to save disk space. Subsequent requests for removed content causes a
remote fetch and local re-caching.

To ensure best performance and guarantee correctness the Registry cache should
be configured to use the `filesystem` driver for storage.

The easiest way to run a registry as a pull through cache is to run the official
Registry image.
At least, you need to specify `proxy.remoteurl` within `/etc/docker/registry/config.yml`
as described in the following subsection.

Multiple registry caches can be deployed over the same back-end. A single
registry cache ensures that concurrent requests do not pull duplicate data,
but this property does not hold true for a registry cache cluster.
