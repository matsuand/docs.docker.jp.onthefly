The Compose file is a [YAML](https://yaml.org) file defining services,
networks, and volumes for a Docker application.

However, if you are using an older version of Docker and want to determine which
Compose release is compatible, refer to the [Compose release
notes](https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/). Each set of release notes
gives details on which versions of Docker Engine are supported, along
with compatible Compose file format versions. (See also, the discussion in
[issue #3404](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/3404).)

The latest and recommended version of the Compose file format is defined by the [Compose Specification](https://github.com/compose-spec/compose-spec/blob/master/spec.md). This format merges the 2.x and 3.x versions and is implemented by **Compose 1.27.0+**.

Compose files that do not declare a version are considered "version 1". In those
files, all the [services](compose-file-v3.md#service-configuration-reference) are
declared at the root of the document.

@z

@x
Version 1 files cannot declare named
[volumes](compose-file-v3.md#volume-configuration-reference), [networks](compose-file-v3.md#network-configuration-reference) or
[build arguments](compose-file-v3.md#args).

@z

@x
Compose does not take advantage of [networking](../networking.md) when you
use version 1: every container is placed on the default `bridge` network and is
reachable from every other container at its IP address. You need to use
`links` to enable discovery between containers.

`volumes` key, and [networks](compose-file-v2.md#network-configuration-reference) can be declared

By default, every container joins an application-wide default network, and is
discoverable at a hostname that's the same as the service name. This means
[links](compose-file-v2.md#links) are largely unnecessary. For more details, see
[Networking in Compose](../networking.md).
