**IMPORTANT**: Starting with this release, Docker is on a monthly release cycle and uses a
new YY.MM versioning scheme to reflect this. Two channels are available: monthly and quarterly.
Any given monthly release will only receive security and bugfixes until the next monthly
release is available. Quarterly releases receive security and bugfixes for 4 months after
initial release. This release includes bugfixes for 1.13.1 but
there are no major feature additions and the API version stays the same.
Upgrading from Docker 1.13.1 to 17.03.0 is expected to be simple and low-risk.

* Shutdown leaks an error when the container was never started [#31279](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/31279)
* Fix possibility of tasks getting stuck in the "NEW" state during a leader failover [docker/swarmkit#1938](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/1938)
* Fix extraneous task creations for global services that led to confusing replica counts in `docker service ls` [docker/swarmkit#1957](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/1957)
* Fix problem that made rolling updates slow when `task-history-limit` was set to 1 [docker/swarmkit#1948](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/1948)
* Restart tasks elsewhere, if appropriate, when they are shut down as a result of nodes no longer satisfying constraints [docker/swarmkit#1958](https://github.com/docker/swarmkit/pull/1958)
* (experimental)
