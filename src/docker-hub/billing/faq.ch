Your organization's number of paid seats must equal the number of organization members. If you're not using all of your organization's paid seats, you can downgrade to pay for fewer seats. Organization owners and members each fill a seat. If you've sent a pending invitation to a prospective organization member, the invitation will fill a seat.

### How do downgrades from a Pro or Team plan work?
When you downgrade your Pro or Team plan, changes are applied at the end of your billing cycle. For example, if you are currently on a Team plan which is billed on the 8th of every month and you choose to downgrade to a Free Team plan on the 15th, your Team plan will be active until 7th of the following month. You will be transferred to a Free Team plan on the 8th of the following month. Please refer to the next two questions below for instructions on how to downgrade your account.

Depending on your configuration you may find it more economical to move to one of the new pricing plans available. For Teams, the key factor affecting a price increase or decrease is the total number of seats you need to support your organization. To optimize your subscription, review our discounted annual plan options, and remove any inactive org members listed in your organization.
